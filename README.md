# Api-node

This API is to keep me up to date on javascript technologies. It uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and for the purpose of creating an API that calls itself another API in async. Nothing really hard to implement.

## Goal

- [x] Create controller.
- [x] Call an other API.
- [x] Async call.
